# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 7 (Iterations) and 8 (Functions) of "The coder's apprentice" Solved exercises 7.11-7.16 and exercises 8.1-8.5.


**Thoughts:** Still struggling with the Monkey and Coconut Challenge. No link to work, since I just started out and wasn't prepared to upload anything.

### Day 2: April 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 9 (Recursive) and Chapter 10 (Strings). Solved the remaining exercises from Chapter 8, the exercises from Chapter 9 and started with the String exercises.

**Thoughts**: Recursive Functions were tough. I quickly grasped the concept but creating my own funtions and understanding what exactly is happening took a lot of time.

### Day 3: April 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 11 (Tuples) and started Chapter 12 (Lists). Signed up on Codewars and solved my first Kata.

**Thoughts**: I was mentally very exhausted by the time I started coding and didn't feel like solving many exercises.

### Day 4: April 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved exercise 10.4 but got stuck on exercise 10.5. Spent a lot of time, trying to solve it but I still wasn't able to. At least I solved a Codewars Kata.
**Thoughts**: How can I spend and hour with two small exercises?!?

### Day 5: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Chapter on Lists and solved the exercises on tuples.
**Thoughts**: 1 hour is always over so quickly.
