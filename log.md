### Day 2: April 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 9 (Recursive) and Chapter 10 (Strings). Solved the remaining exercises from Chapter 8, the exercises from Chapter 9 and started with the String exercises.

**Thoughts**: Recursive Functions were tough. I quickly grasped the concept but creating my own funtions and understanding what exactly is happening took a lot of time.
