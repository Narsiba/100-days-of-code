# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 7 (Iterations) and 8 (Functions) of "The coder's apprentice" Solved exercises 7.11-7.16 and exercises 8.1-8.5.


**Thoughts:** Still struggling with the Monkey and Coconut Challenge. No link to work, since I just started out and wasn't prepared to upload anything.

**Link to work:** No link to work, since I just started out and wasn't prepared to upload anything.


### Day 2: April 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 9 (Recursive) and Chapter 10 (Strings). Solved the remaining exercises from Chapter 8, the exercises from Chapter 9 and started with the String exercises.

**Thoughts**: Recursive Functions were tough. I quickly grasped the concept but creating my own funtions and understanding what exactly is happening took a lot of time.

### Day 3: April 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Chapter 11 (Tuples) and started Chapter 12 (Lists). Signed up on Codewars and solved my first Kata.

**Thoughts**: I was mentally very exhausted by the time I started coding and didn't feel like solving many exercises.

### Day 4: April 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved exercise 10.4 but got stuck on exercise 10.5. Spent a lot of time, trying to solve it but I still wasn't able to. At least I solved a Codewars Kata.

**Thoughts**: How can I spend and hour with two small exercises?!?

### Day 5: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Chapter on Lists and solved the exercises on tuples.

**Thoughts**: 1 hour is always over so quickly.

### Day 6: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Turns out Chapter 12 about Lists wasn't finished. Learned about aliasing, deepcopies, and list comprehension. Solved some exercises.

**Thoughts**: I prefer lists to strings.

### Day 7: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lists, lists, lists. Solving exercises.

**Thoughts**: One hour just doesn't seem to  b enough time to make progress.

### Day 8: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: TicTacToe Game 

**Thoughts**: Still stuck with letter count exercise.


### Day 9: May 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished TicTacToe Game, found solution to letter_count function and halfway through programming a battleship game.

**Thoughts**: list functions don't return the list, the just mutate it.

### Day 10: May 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Battleship Game, worked on the Dictionaries chapter.

**Thoughts:** Quite a bit of coding today. First idea for an app but require more knowledge about Python.
